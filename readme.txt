Annotate any text in a blog post and add a comment to it.

== Description ==

ILAnnotations allows you to select a text in a blog post and add your comment to it.
The plugin uses the standard comments engine of WordPress, so all other comment plugins should work just fine with it.
Shortcodes are used to mark the highlighted text. This allows you to still edit a post and move stuff around without losing the annotations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ILAnnotations` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Have fun! (There are no settings)
